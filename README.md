InfixCalculator
===============

A simplistic module for parsing and calculating an infix expression.

The calculation itself is based upon postfix notation, meaning that the original expression will be converted.
It handles addition, subtraction, multiplication, division and parenthesis, as well as unary addition and subtraction alongside both integer and floating point operands.
